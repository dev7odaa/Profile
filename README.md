# Profile
###### The app is composed of 2 screens, first is the profile screen, it has the username and address pinned at the top and then it lists all of this userâ€™s albums. When you press on any album it navigates to the second screen which is an album details screen that contains a list of the images in a recycler view grid. Also, you have a search bar that you can filter within the photos album by the image title.

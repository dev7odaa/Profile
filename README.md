# Profile
###### The app is composed of 2 screens, first is the profile screen, it has the user_name and address pinned at the top and then it lists all of this userâ€™s albums. When you press on any album it navigates to the second screen which is an album details screen that contains list of the images in an recyclerview grid. Also you have search bar that you can filter within the photos album by the  image title.
